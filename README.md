**GrammarGuard** is a desktop GUI application designed for those who value data sovereignty. Unlike popular grammar tools that send your keystrokes to the cloud, GrammarGuard processes everything locally on your machine.

Whether you are working on sensitive legal documents, proprietary code comments, or personal journals, GrammarGuard ensures your text never leaves your computer.
